# TerminalChat

TerminalChat is an open-source, web-based chat application that provides a unique and engaging chat experience with a terminal-like interface. What sets TerminalChat apart is that it was entirely developed using advanced AI language models, specifically Claude and GPT-4, without any human coding involved. That's right, from the backend to the frontend, every line of code was generated by these cutting-edge AI assistants.

## AI-Driven Development

TerminalChat showcases the power and potential of AI in software development. By leveraging the capabilities of Claude and GPT-4, the entire application was built from scratch without the need for human programmers. This demonstrates the incredible abilities of these AI models in understanding requirements, generating code, and creating functional applications.

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- Terminal-like interface: The chat interface resembles a command-line terminal, providing a nostalgic and immersive experience.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- Easy deployment: TerminalChat can be easily deployed using Docker, making it simple to set up and run.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The backend of the application is built using Python, leveraging the Flask web framework.
- Flask-SocketIO: Used for enabling real-time communication between the server and the clients.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The frontend of the application is built using these web technologies.
- Docker: Used for containerization and easy deployment of the application.
- AI: The entire development process was driven by Claude and GPT-4, showcasing the potential of advanced AI language models in software development.

## Getting Started

To run TerminalChat, you have two options:

### Option 1: Run from Docker Hub

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.

2. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:

```
    docker pull redbaron23/terminalchat
```

3. Run the Docker container:

```
    docker run -p 80:80 --name terminalchat-container redbaron23/terminalchat
```

4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost` to access the TerminalChat application.

### Option 2: Build and Run Locally

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.

2. Clone the repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/redbaron23/TerminalChat.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

```
    cd TerminalChat
```

4. Build the Docker image:

```
    docker build -t terminalchat .
```

5. Run the Docker container:

```
    docker run -p 80:80 --name terminalchat-container terminalchat
```

6. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost` to access the TerminalChat application.

### Option 3: Build and Run Locally and on Tor Network

1. **Optional: Prepare Hidden Service Configuration**

   If you want to use a custom hidden service configuration:

   - Create a `hidden_service` folder under `tor-config`.
   - Include the following files:
     - `hostname` (the hostname of your hidden service)
     - `hs_ed25519_public_key` (optional; if not provided, it will be generated)
     - `hs_ed25519_secret_key` (optional; if not provided, it will be generated)

   These files are necessary for configuring your hidden service on the Tor network.

2. **Build the Docker Image**

   Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.tor`):

   ```bash
       docker build -t tor-chat -f Dockerfile.tor .
   ```

3. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container with the following command:

    ```
        docker run -d \
            --name my-tor-container \
            -v $(pwd)/tor-config/hidden_service:/var/lib/tor/hidden_service \
            -p 80:80 \
            tor-chat
    ```

- --name my-tor-container: Assigns the name my-tor-container to the Docker container.
- -v $(pwd)/tor-config/hidden_service:/var/lib/tor/hidden_service: Mounts the tor-config/hidden_service directory on your host to /var/lib/tor/hidden_service inside the container, allowing the container to use the specified hidden service configuration.
- -p 80:80: Maps port 80 on the host to port 80 inside the container, enabling access to your application over HTTP.
- tor-chat: Specifies the name of the Docker image to run.

## Docker Hub

TerminalChat is available on Docker Hub, making it easy to pull and run the application using Docker.

To pull the Docker image from Docker Hub, run the following command:

```

    docker pull redbaron23/terminalchat

```

To run the Docker container from Docker Hub, use the following command:

```

    docker run -p 80:80 --name terminalchat-container redbaron23/terminalchat

```

Or if you prefer to use the tor network version

```
    docker run -p 80:80 --name terminalchat-container redbaron23/terminalchat-tor
```

This will pull the TerminalChat image from Docker Hub and start the container, making the application accessible at `http://localhost`.
